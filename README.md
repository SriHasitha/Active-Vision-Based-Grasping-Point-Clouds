# Active-Vision-Based-Grasping-Point-Clouds

**Note: This repo is currently under development and updates are in progress. Please note that the code and documentation are actively being updated. Thanks for understanding.**

This repository contains the implementation of an active vision-based grasping system using point clouds. The objective of this project is to develop a robust algorithm that can perform grasping tasks using 3D point cloud data obtained from sensors.
